 THE BACK STORY...

 You will travel to the world of Kyrandia, a fairy tale land of magic and
 mystery, realm of the beautiful and powerful goddess of Kyrandia, Tashanna,
 the "Lady of Legends."  Here, you begin as a young apprentice from a small
 village who seeks to grow in knowledge, wisdom, and power, with high hopes of
 being granted the title of "Arch-Mage of Legends" -- the mightiest wizard of
 Kyrandia!  To achieve your goal, you must cross the lands of Kyrandia, face
 unknown perils, solve mystical enigmas, battle rivalrous mages, and conqueror
 your own mind, body, and soul.

 Time has stood still for too long on Kyrandia -- now is the time for one mage
 to rise above and master the powers of sorcery and magic.
 
 WHAT IS KYRANDIA?

 Kyrandia (Fantasy-world) is a multi-player interactive game in which many
 players can adventure with each other in the same simulated adventure world.
 Players can help one another, engage in battle, trade information, or just
 "shoot the breeze."

 Kyrandia takes place in the world of Kyrandia, the realm of the goddess
 Tashanna. In many ways, Kyrandia is the culmination of learning and growth
 by the authors after building the Peyennuu-based games (Quest for Magic,
 Quest of the Alchemists, Alchemy II: The Hangover, Quest for Sorcery, and
 Quest for Sorcery II a/k/a Sorcerer's Isles). 

 The object of the game is to grow, solve puzzles, and become the first 
 "Arch-Mage of Legends" on the system.

 GAMEPLAY
 
 To move about in Kyrandia, type the direction you want your character to go
 (north, south, east or west).  You can speak with other players using action
 verbs.  For example, if you were to type "say hello there", other players at
 the same location would see "hello there."  You may pick up objects and do
 things with them.  You can look at your current surroundings or other players.
 Almost any mundane action you can think of can be performed.

 However, the world of Kyrandia is much, much more.  The underlying theme of
 the entire game is the use of magic.  Similar in concept to the popular role-
 playing game "Dungeons & Dragons," players are "magic-users" who start at
 level 1 (Apprentice) and advance to higher levels and more powerful magic.
 
 SPELLS
 
 Spells are magic cast by players, sometimes at objects or other players.  To
 cast a spell a player must first have it memorized.  He must also have enough
 spell points to cast it, and must be of high enough level for certain spells.
 Also, some spells require the player to have certain components (objects) to
 cast them.  To actually cast the spell, a player must type "cast" and then the
 secret incantation of the spell to be cast; sometimes, a direct object must be
 included as well, such as "at the elf".

 The physical strength and endurance of a player is determined by his "hit
 points."  A player's hit points increase as he gains levels or by magical
 means.  It is through hit points that most players battle each other; when a
 player's hit points reach 0, he is killed, and must start from scratch at the
 beginning again.

 To see what spells you have memorized and how many spell points you have, type
 "spells".  To see how many hit points you have, type "hits".  To see what
 objects you are holding, type "inv".  And if you need it, type "help".

 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the archive to your Major BBS server directory, add 
 it to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, and start 
 Major BBS!  It's that easy! 

 Kyrandia has three message files. Within ELWKYRM, you can define the key 
 required to play the game, and decide whether to allow users to exchange 
 Kyrandia gold for BBS credits. There are also some solution strings in 
 level 4, and general text blocks in level 6. The other two files customize 
 location text (ELWKYRL.MSG) and SysOp editor text (ELWKYRS.MSG).  

 MODULE HISTORY
 
 Kyrandia was one of a series of 7 text-based adventure RPGs written by Scott
 Brinker. It is the culmination of work begun with the Quest for Magic game,
 which itself was based upon Fazuul by Tim Stryker, which at the time, was
 mired in copyright issues as it was written pre-Galacticomm for a client. It
 is set in a new world and had far more complexity than its predecessors. It
 was a very popular module throughout The Major BBS era from version 5 through
 Worldgroup. Toward the end of the Galacticomm era the focus on add-on modules
 waned.
 
 The game was the focus of legal controversy. A licensee of the module was
 affiliated with Westwood Studios, a video game company. In 1992, that company
 released a game The Legend of Kyrandia, followed in 1993 by Legend of Kyrandia
 Book Two: The Hand of Fate and in 1994 by Book 3 Malcolm's Revenge. The games
 clearly took the name and some of the solutions (changing gem names, end
 target to King, etc.). Galacticomm initially hired legal counsel, but as it
 dragged on, with Galacticomm's financial situation deteriorating, the suit was
 dropped due to the cost. Very disappointing as the games were successful (and
 rather good!) but Galacticomm, Scott Brinker, and Richard Skurnick received
 nothing despite the obvious theft.

 Kyrandia was acquired by Elwynor Technologies in 2005 along with the rest of
 the Galacticomm intellectual property. It was fully ported to Worldgroup 3.2
 in April 2021, and ported to The Major BBS v10 in April 2023.
